    <p>This is a project that I created in my APP Academy class. This was a server/client side multiplayer game that I chose to call Dead by Pixel-Light. The game was made primarily made using the external code libraries <a href = "http://www.p5js.org" target = "_blank">P5.js</a> and <a href = "socket.io" target = "_blank">Socket.io</a>. The inspiration for my game was based off the asymmetrical horror game <a href = "http://www.deadbydaylight.com" target = "_blank">Dead by Daylight</a>.</p>

    <p>The objective of the game for the survivors (blue squares) is to capture the generators (green squares) while avoiding the killer that is hunting them down. The objective for the killer is to stop the survivors from capturing all the generators. All the survivors have one life and are eliminated from the game once the killer collides with them.</p>
