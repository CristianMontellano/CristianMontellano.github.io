    <div class = "info"><p>I am an AP and honors student currently in the 11th grade. I have interests in computer science and computer engineering. I found my interests in this during the summer before my 9th grade year. I found the vast capabilities and possibilities that computers had to interest me. This led me to join Pasadena High School in order to join the APP Academy in order to follow my passion. The APP Academy helps teach its students coding skills during the four year process.</p>
        <p >I am also a student participant in the Partnership for Success Program. This is a community based program for the Pasadena Unified School District that supports growth of the student participants. This is done through the use of Pasadena campuses such as the Polytechnic South campus and Chandler School. My favorite classes are Math and APP. These are my favorite classes because I feel that these will be the most important for my future and have brought me to the edge of my own mind as I continue to want to learn more.</p>
