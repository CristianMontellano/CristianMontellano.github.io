    <p>This is an essay that I wrote during my 9th grade English class. The essay was an analytical essay that we wrote after watching the Dante's Inferno movie which was based on the book. The essay was supposed to focus on one of the rings of hell that the movie portrayed and explain its portrayal through evidence provided by the movie and real world. The ring I chose for my essay was the seventh circle which was the circle of violence. The reason I chose this circle was due to the representation given to it by the movie, as well as the abundance of examples in the real world that could be used. What I found most interesting about this was the that violence though abundant in our everyday lives is one of the most difficult topics that can be discussed due to all the fears and speculations about it.</p>
