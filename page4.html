<h2>Explanation</h2>
    <div class = "info">
        <p>Partnership for Success is a community based program for Pasadena Unified School District students that supports growth of its student participants. The program is held during the summer through the use of Pasadena schools such as Chandler School, Altadena Elementary, Westridge, and Polytechnic Southern Campus. The students in the program are selected by teacher recommendation during the student's 5th grade year and then begin during the summer of that year. The program focuses on providing classes that will benefit the student in their upcoming year or that can give the student knowledge in a topic they may need. The classes they give to the students range from Human Rights, Studio Art Fundamentals, The Cold War Era Through Cinema & Music, Chinese Language & Culture, and College Counseling.</p>

<h2>Essay Examples</h2>
    <div class = "info">
        <p>This was an essay that I wrote for my Human Rights class during the 10th grade summer. The essay was meant to choose an explain a leader in the fight for human rights. The reason I chose Cesar Chavez was due to the effect he had for millions of farmers in the U.S. that were affected by the lack of rights.</p>

        <p>This was one of the three leters we wrote for my Human Rights class during the 10th grade summer. The letters were written through the use of information given by <a href = "https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a>. The letters were meant to show our opinion of the abandonment of Human Rights while keeping a calm and precise writing style.</p>
